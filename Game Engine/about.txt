Thats right, I'm making a game engine. Isn't that exciting?
So far I've figured out how to separate window creation into a separate
library class. 
Actually I know a bit more, but I haven't had time to implement it yet. 

I'm reading through "Programming Windows 5th Ed."
I've learned how to make multiple windows (including child windows)
hot to take keyboard input (in a basic text editor manner),
capture mouse input, and draw some basic lines. 

The graphics part of the engine will be done in OpenGL, which I have also spent
a bit of time learning. 

More exciting demo coming soon!
